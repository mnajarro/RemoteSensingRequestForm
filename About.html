		<p id="p5">
			<b>About the Remote Sensing Program</b><br><br>
			The GeoCenter works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of USAID's development programs by geographically prioritizing resources where they will maximize development impact. To this end, the GeoCenter administers the Remote Sensing Program, which provides high-resolution satellite imagery at no cost to USAID Operating Units and Implementing Partners. To meet the needs of USAID projects, the GeoCenter also provides consultations to missions and Washington-based offices to increase the agency's understanding of the imagery provided and how imagery can improve development projects.  </p> 

		<p id="p5">
			All imagery acquired through the remote sensing program falls under the terms of the <a href="NextView.html">NextView License</a>.

			<b>About the GeoCenter</b><br><br>
			
			The goal of the GeoCenter is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of USAID's development programs by geographically prioritizing resources where they will maximize development impact. 
			The GeoCenter team works directly with field missions and Washington-based bureaus to integrate a geographic approach into the strategic planning, design, monitoring, and evaluation of USAID's development programs. 
			The team provides the following services:
		</p>
		<p id="p5">
			<span id="AboutSubtitle"><b>Mapping and Analysis</b></span> Working directly with USAID staff, the GeoCenter uses geographic data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to increase analytic rigor and data-driven decision-making throughout the Program Cycle. 
			Geographic analysis and mapping serve a key role in defining development priorities to identify where to achieve development results, as well as assess program performance.
		</p>
		<p id="p5">
			<span id="AboutSubtitle"><b>Building Geospatial Capacity</b></span> The GeoCenter provides training in geographic concepts and GIS technology for development, expert consulting and guidance on incorporating GIS into Agency programs, and short-term technical assistance to field missions to establish mission-based GIS capacity.
		</p>
		<p id="p5">
			<span id="AboutSubtitle"><b>Resources and Methods to Collect, Manage, and Share Data</b></span>  The GeoCenter is developing an enterprise GIS solution for the Agency that will enable USAID staff to access, map, analyze, and share geographic data internally and externally on a web-based platform. 
			It also conducts innovative activities to crowd-source data collection and openly share geospatial data for public use.
		</p>
		<p id="p5">
			<span id="AboutSubtitle"><b>GIS Community of Practice</b></span>  The GeoCenter supports a network of more than 40 GIS Specialists across the Agency, including 20 missions and 4 Washington-based offices.
		</p>
		<p id="p5">
			<span id="AboutSubtitle"><b>Engaging with External Geospatial Communities</b></span>  The GeoCenter has established relationships with the international, interagency, private sector, non-profit, and academic geospatial communities. 
			Collaboration with these communities increases access to valuable data and tools from different sources, partnerships in geospatial innovation, and opportunities to provide thought leadership in the application of geospatial technologies for development.
